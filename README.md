GiveNGet is a community-driven mobile app that makes giving and receiving free items simple
and hassle-free. Unlike traditional marketplaces focused on buying and selling, GiveNGet is 
designed exclusively for donations, helping users declutter their homes while directly 
supporting others in need. Inspired by platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Karrot 
and Too Good to Go, the app allows users to list items they no longer need, browse available 
donations, and connect with recipients in their local area—all without the complications
of money or transactions.


With GiveNGet, users can post items they wish to donate, search and filter listings by category, 
save favorites for later, and communicate with donors through in-app message posting. 
The app’s intuitive interface makes it easy to turn unwanted items into opportunities for others, 
reducing waste and fostering a sense of community along the way. Whether you’re looking to donate 
or find something you need, GiveNGet makes it simple to give what you don’t need and get what 
you do—completely free of charge.
